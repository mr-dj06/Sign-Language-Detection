# Sign Language Detection

The project aims to develop a real-time gesture recognition system specifically tailored for sign language detection, with a particular focus on **American Sign Language (ASL)**.


## Introduction

In a world where communication serves as the cornerstone of human interaction, the barriers faced by individuals who rely on sign language for expression are profound. The deaf and hard of hearing community often encounters challenges in effectively communicating with others who do not understand sign language.
## Implementation

### System Flow
```
Data Collection
      ↓
Data Preprocessing
      ↓
Model Training
      ↓
Real-Time Detection
```
## Working

```
install python and required dependencies(os, numpy, cvzone, cv2, tensorflow, keras)
and run the test.py file

now you will be able to see pop up window in which you can show your hand and our model will be able to detect the letter(in the top of the box).

You can refer the reference images folder.
